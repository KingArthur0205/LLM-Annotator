<Task Overview>
You are tasked with classifying student utterances from a mathematics classroom transcript.

You will be given a list of dialogue utterances. Each utterance is formatted as:
<uttid>: <utterance text>

Your goal is to assign **exactly one** label to each utterance according to the label definitions provided below. 
Choose the label that best matches the **content and intent** of the utterance, even if the utterance is partial, unclear, or contains errors.

You must output your annotations in strict **JSON format**, using the utterance IDs (<uttid>) as keys and the assigned labels as string values.

Be accurate and consistent:
- Only use labels from the provided list.
- Do not invent new labels.
- If unsure, choose the label that most closely matches based on provided examples.
- Minor grammatical mistakes or incomplete sentences should not change the intent.
