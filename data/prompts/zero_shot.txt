<Task Overview>
You are tasked with classifying student utterances from a mathematics classroom transcript.

You will be given a list of dialogue utterances. Each utterance is formatted as:
<uttid>: <utterance text>

For each utterance, assign exactly one label based on the provided label definitions. 
Focus on the **meaning and intent** of the utterance, even if it is fragmented, grammatically incorrect, or informal.

Classification Instructions:
- Use only labels from the provided list.
- Assign exactly one label per utterance.
- Base your decision on the overall purpose or function of the utterance, not minor wording variations.
- If an utterance could fit multiple labels, select the label that best matches its **primary intent**.
- If the utterance is ambiguous, select the most reasonable label based on its apparent context.

You must output your annotations in **strict JSON format**:
- Use the <uttid> as the key.
- Use the assigned label as a string value.
- Output only a valid JSON object with no additional explanation or commentary.
